      "BY THE MINISTER OF PLANNING AND THE ECONOMY\n",
      "This articulation of policy for action by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago over the period 2011-2014 is meant to bring focus to the work of the Government over the next three (3) years. Basically therefore, the vision articulated here will be supported by three (3) budgets over the fiscal years 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013- 14 within the context of a Medium Term Fiscal Framework. The policy thrust embraced in this document, has evolved from our vision and perspective as articulated in the 2010 Manifesto of the People's Partnership, which early in the life of this Government was adopted by Cabinet as Government Policy.\n",
      "Manifesto 2010\n",
      "That document built around the vision and theme of 'Prosperity for All', identified items for action within the first 120 days of the life of this Government, shared with the citizenry the seven (7) guiding pillars that would inform policy and which indeed has guided policy and action over the last 16 months. It also committed each Ministry to an action plan for the first fiscal year October 2010-September 2011 in the context of the 2010-11 budget statement and it sought to institutionalise the strategic planning culture and to make the crafting of strategic plans and their implementation an essential part of the work of each Ministry.\n",
      "A significant number of items identified for action during the first 120 days has either been initiated or fully achieved (24 out of 32).\n",
      "Ministerial Priorities\n",
      "Most Ministries have operated since October 2010 on the basis of some plan for priority action over the 12 month period that has brought us up to this point - September 2011. These were by no means perfect but they provided a navigatable road map that made focused action possible. Looking forward to the year ahead (October 2011-September 2012) every Ministry has defined a clear agenda for action and has identified action priorities in a precise way for the period 2011-14 as part of their strategic planning initiative. These Ministerial priorities are identified\n",
      "i\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "in Appendix II of this document.\n",
      "Delivery to the People\n",
      "What the Government has delivered to the people of Trinidad and Tobago during the period 2010-11 as a national community and in specific communities across the nation as goods and services, is identifiable and has been documented. This will be shared with citizens so that collectively, our national community can have a sense of the serious commitment of their Government to work on their behalf and the differential impact that is being made by a government that is committed to the principle that people should be at the centre of all development interventions. Delivery of goods and services in this quantum and with such intensity over a relatively short period, has been facilitated by a Public Service that has begun to emphasise service to our citizens as an essential part of its core mandate and function; and as a fundamental principle which drives philosophy, policy and practice of this Administration led by the Honourable Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime Minister.\n",
      "Learnings\n",
      "There can be little doubt, therefore, that the experience, exposure and learnings of the last sixteen (16) months have also influenced this Policy Framework 2011-14, so that any gap between policy and practice, intention and action, vision and reality are likely to be smaller as we go forward.\n",
      "Vision and Mission\n",
      "As the years unfold, it is our intention to bring practical good sense to bear on policy, implementation and action plans and to review and revise, as may become necessary. However the direction that we have set out in this Medium-Term Policy document for an innovation- driven, growth economy to spur a rising tide of prosperity for all, with a commitment to economic inclusiveness, greater equity and more meaningful citizen participation, is both firm and clear. From this vision of an innovation-led economy that brings our people together under conditions of prosperity - we shall never deviate.\n",
      "Results Based Framework\n",
      "Also influencing our policy perspective for the next three (3) years has been the results-based framework developed around the seven (7) strategic pillars for development which drives government policy. Since June of this year (2011), the National Transformation Unit (NTU) of the Ministry of Planning and the Economy, with consultancy support, has been teasing out the results to be delivered under each of the seven (7) pillars. This work has been done by clustering Ministries together to facilitate meaningful interactive discussion, integrated\n",
      "ii\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "planning and execution for impact with a focus on results to be achieved. Execution\n",
      "This kind of work will continue to strengthen the execution process and to assess impact on an ongoing basis. Annual plans of Ministries and collaborative effort across Ministries will be measured against results identified for delivery and achievement. That way, progress can be monitored and evaluated; corrective measures taken and strategic interventions to support achievement of results, facilitated.\n",
      "Monitoring and Evaluation\n",
      "A structure, system and a set of processes exist for monitoring, evaluation, feedback and enhancement of performance. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Ministry of Planning and the Economy has been established for this purpose and will be strengthened. At the end of the day, the purpose of policy is to establish a framework within which plans are developed, priorities identified, an action agenda established, anticipated results determined and within which execution to deliver anticipated results can take place. Success ultimately depends on political directorate and public service working together to achieve common objectives and to deliver agreed results. If this is done well, the ultimate beneficiaries are our citizens and, of course, the national economy and social system.\n",
      "Shared Purpose\n",
      "Important in all of this though, is a sense of shared purpose by citizens of our country that we are striving together to achieve clear, elevated, mutually beneficial goals, so that we all have a sense of being able to do our part in a larger, national enterprise.\n",
      "At the heart of the thinking behind our policy framework is that we must work together to create a mutually respectful place for discussion, dialogue and meaningful action by designing forums for government, business, labour and civil society to sit together and talk things through. This thinking also makes the assumption that communities will take responsibility for bringing citizens together for the purpose of civic engagement, to make one another aware of issues and to seek to influence the development process in a constructive and meaningful way. We are all in this together. We must, therefore, make our way forward and upward, together.\n",
      "National Policy\n",
      "This framework document does not single out Tobago or Trinidad or any section of our country. It represents a vision, mission and policy framework for the whole country - every single citizen.\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "iii\n",
      "Some may be concerned that growth targets have not been set for each of the three (3) years ahead given the fact that the general tone of this policy document is optimistic. From our point of view, we must aspire to build the growth momentum and strive vigourosly to achieve higher rates of growth. Should the world change we will respond, should we fall short we will make adjustments; should momentum build we will seek to leverage the bouyancy.\n",
      "This policy framework anchored on the seven (7) pillars will guide action as we go forward over the next three (3) years.\n",
      "I thank the Honourable Prime Minister and all Cabinet Ministers and Government Parliamentarians for their input, comments and support and I thank those members of staff of the Ministry of Planning and the Economy who worked with me on this document so diligently and so well. Their support, dedicated work and commitment have been a source of strength and inspiration.\n",
      "It is our hope that this policy framework will be read, understood and internalized by a broad spectrum of stakeholders and citizens. It is our hope that the vision and mission will be embraced by all and turned into action by all stakeholders and all citizens.\n",
      "Through creativity, innovation and collaboration we shall prosper together - that is the vision embraced in this Medium Term Policy Framework 2011-14; and so we establish the theme for this policy document as we go forward - 'Innovation For Lasting Prosperity'.\n",
      "October 2011 finds the world in a condition of uncertainity as well as unpredictability - the norm for our times. In our quest to achieve lasting prosperity through innovation we cannot promise certainty but it is our hope that we have provided in this Medium Term Policy Framework some measure of clarity of intent, purpose and direction and identified our priorities for action over the next three (3) years.\n",
      "Each year, on the basis of progress, achievement, whatever setbacks we may encounter and in the context of an ever changing environment, there will be some tweaking of emphasis; but the commitment to our vision and mission and to action as required remains firm. Transformation of the Trinidad and Tobago economy is an imperative.\n",
      "The current structure of our economy will not support sustainability in the future. Thoughtfully\n",
      "iv\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "targeted interventions and sustained intensity of effort are required now to effect the diversification and economic transformation that has become a national imperative.\n",
      "The world may change dramatically and suddenly and we may have to adjust to those changes in the environment and in our circumstances. The imperatives for a more productive and competitive, diversified economy, driven by innovation, as articulated in this Medium Term Policy Framework 2011-14 under the theme 'Innovation for Lasting Prosperity' cannot and must not be postponed any longer. Action on all fronts is required now as never before. This would be true under any conditions - favourable or adverse.\n",

      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "This Medium-Term Policy Framework (MTPF) 2011-2014, embracing the theme 'Innovation for Lasting Prosperity' outlines Government's perspective and intent on the socio-economic transformation that needs to take place in order to achieve our commitment to the people of Trinidad and Tobago of 'Prosperity for All'. It is intended to be the first of the MTPFs to be articulated by this Government.\n",
      "Within the context of the seven (7) development pillars articulated by the Government, the main thrusts of this MTPF are:\n",
      "· To diversify and deepen the production base in order to ensure that in a context of depleting energy resources, the economy will continue to grow and sustain a high standard of living\n",
      "· To move the economy up the value chain, improve competitiveness and expand investment both local and foreign\n",
      "· To have a secure and safe nation and to strengthen the framework, institutions and infrastructure to support human security\n",
      "· To expand the capacity of our citizens for knowledge accumulation and use, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial activity\n",
      "· To reduce socio-economic and regional inequalities within our borders, move people out of poverty and promote social inclusion through more meaningful economic participation\n",
      "As the first overarching planning document of the new Administration, the opportunity has been taken in Part I to articulate in some detail the broad strategic direction being taken to restructure and transform the economy and the society; and the policy shifts that are necessarily being engineered to ensure that there is a decisive departure from past attempts at managing our development. This is in keeping with our understanding of the expectations of our citizens as well as in keeping with our commitment to them to lead and effect change.\n",
      "This policy framework is a landmark achievement as it represents the first time any attempt has been made to integrate and articulate Government's approach to development on the basis of shared priorities and cross cutting interventions. It represents a departure from the independent approach of State entities which results in the creation of silos. This framework encourages\n",
      "1\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "greater collaboration and the establishment of functional relationships among Ministries and agencies in an attempt to achieve greater coherence and effectiveness in implementing Government's development objectives. Moreover, it provides clarity on Government's objectives, which is beneficial for all stakeholders.\n",
      "In setting five (5) priorities for action over the next three (3) years, the Government is effectively responding to some of the major concerns of the population while, at the same time, setting the foundations for achieving sustainable economic and social advancement of all citizens in the future. The priorities as elaborated in Part II of this MTPF are:\n",
      "1. Crime and Law and Order;\n",
      "2. Agriculture and Food Security;\n",
      "3. Health Care Services and Hospitals;\n",
      "4. Economic Growth, Job Creation, Competitiveness and Innovation; and\n",
      "5. Poverty Reduction and Human Capital Development.\n",
      "A final chapter outlines the role of the key stakeholders and the new institutional arrangements that have been put in place to guide and manage the development process.\n",
      "The Appendices identify the main projects in the 2011/2012 Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) that are aligned to the five (5) priorities for action over the planning horizon and the specific priorities of each Ministry.\n",

      "THE FRAMEWORK FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Trinidad and Tobago has benefitted from a range of initiatives in the past, but is now embarking on an entirely new phase of its development. While optimising opportunities from oil and gas, which includes diversification of the energy sector, the rock of our revenue so far, Trinidad and Tobago must craft a strategy for survival, growth and sustainability in a scenario in which the assumption must be that petroleum resources are finite. Going forward, the goal is to shift from the over dependence on hydrocarbon resources to an emphasis on the development of human capital and the alignment of through-put from the education and training sector with an investment, diversification, competitiveness and innovation strategy. However more favourable the situation might eventually turn out to be in the hydrocarbon sector, it is prudent to take decisions now to engineer a policy shift that will result in sustainable growth, in a context in which oil and gas are no longer the mainstay of the Trinidad and Tobago economy.\n",
      "As Government engages in the process of economic transformation, a simultaneous and complementary effort of social transformation must take place, understanding that social transformation can both influence and be influenced by economic transformation. The goal is to create the conditions which will engender greater equity and inclusiveness in the society through expanded opportunities for wealth generation and accumulation and participation in the national development process for each individual, community and region in the country.\n",
      "Government's economic and social transformation strategy is based on the following four (4) principles:\n",
      "1. Generate productivity-led growth on the basis of a more diversified production structure with the emphasis on value and wealth creation;\n",
      "2. Create the conditions for greater inclusiveness and equity in socio-economic development;\n",
      "3. Build the knowledge and talent of our human resources; and\n",
      "4. Pursue socio-economic development in the context of prudent spatial management and environmental limits.\n",
      "5\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "THE CHALLENGE OF ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION\n",
      "The global landscape is full of challenges and uncertainties that will impact on Trinidad and Tobago's ability to successfully manage the transition from an energy dependent economy. Globalisation and rapid technological advances have resulted in fundamental, long-term changes in commerce and industry. Markets, industries and companies have become global in scope with few products being made entirely in a single country. Labour is now internationally mobile, existing jobs are becoming obsolete and new occupations require greater knowledge, skills and adaptability from workers. Countries are now competing with each other for talent and capital, while skilled workforces and business-friendly environments have become critical elements of international competitiveness.\n",
      "There is an economic power shift that is evolving in the world and that will take some time to resolve itself. But, while a significant proportion of the world is in relative turmoil, the Region in which we live is one of relative stability poised for growth.\n",
      "At the same time, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) have strengthened their domestic capabilities and enhanced their economies and new players, especially from Asia have emerged. These countries have become formidable global competitors as they attract high levels of investment and export more sophisticated products.\n",
      "Nevertheless, opportunities exist for countries such as Trinidad and Tobago to create a viable economic base in knowledge-based industries. The challenge for us is to develop a global niche by excelling in selected products, while forging strategic links with economic partners, so that exports can flourish in international markets. The emphasis has to be on high valued goods that can support higher paying jobs and greater competitiveness.\n",
      "Apart from the external factors, there are internal challenges as well. Foremost among them are the creation of a conducive business environment and the building of a high quality human capital base to drive the shift towards a higher level of value creation and productivity. Although Trinidad and Tobago has done fairly well economically, it lags behind many developing countries in productivity and innovation. Closing this gap is central to economic diversification. To be competitive, Trinidad and Tobago must seek not only to become better in its current operations, but also make quantum leaps in producing innovative products and services.\n",
      "6\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "Higher levels of productivity must be the cornerstone of any effort to create a sustainable, diversified economy. In addition, greater focus has to be placed on attracting a larger flow of visitors, well spread out across any given year to create a larger consumer market for the goods and services that we produce. Developing and aggressively marketing Brand T&T in external markets must also be given priority attention.\n",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's economy is dominated by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the low levels of international competition in the domestic marketplace are structural problems that are difficult to overcome. Moreover, the external environment for Trinidad and Tobago's energy products has changed as new players such as Qatar and Russia have emerged and countries such as the United States of America are aggressively seeking alternative sources of energy. On the supply side, our oil and gas industry is at the maturity stage of its life cycle. In addition, our fiscal position has become tighter due to a less buoyant economy, as revenue has been reduced. In terms of expenditure, there are increasing pressures for greater spending on wages and social infrastructure, including health care and sustaining the level of transfers and subsidies presents a major challenge.\n",
      "BUILDING A COMPETITIVE, INNOVATION-DRIVEN ECONOMY\n",
      "For Trinidad and Tobago, global competitiveness has four (4) dimensions: being internationally competitive within the domestic market, being competitive enough in the global market to systematically expand exports particularly in niche areas, developing locally-based firms with global presence and attracting international firms that regard our human talent pool as a competitive asset in a knowledge-based, technologically-driven economy.\n",
      "In order to sustain higher levels of growth, Government will continue to strengthen the foundations of the economy, diversify and restructure it and establish a formidable IT platform. As such, the focus of the medium-term economic strategy will be on the promotion of a conducive environment for growth and competitiveness on a foundation of macroeconomic stability; by strengthening the functioning of the legal system; by providing stable Government; by promoting savings and investment; by making strategic interventions with public sector spending especially in social infrastructure projects and high impact interventions in communities and in job creation. However, a sound foundation alone, though essential, is not sufficient to guarantee the growth and expansion that is required.\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "7\n",
      "The agenda for economic transformation aims to reposition Trinidad and Tobago from competing on the basis of production processes and investment in plants to an information, technology-driven, innovative, knowledge-based and globally connected economy; the foundation of which is rooted in the acquisition, exploitation, creation and strategic deployment of knowledge and skills. We must transform Trinidad and Tobago's current mix of goods and services into products and services of higher value. In this effort, there is an increasingly important role for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises which have a greater potential to successfully tap niche areas. The objective is to have products and services that differentiate themselves in the world market place on the basis of quality, value and innovation rather than on price alone. In so doing, we must also move aggressively to improve the skills base of the workforce, expand exports, improve the quality of jobs, generate higher incomes and effect a significant growth in productivity.\n",
      "To move the economy to a higher growth plane, Government is committed to the promotion of innovation as the basis for transforming existing production systems and creating new goods and services. Over the medium-term, the emphasis will be on the following:\n",
      "· Establishing an innovation system with supporting mechanisms for financing, intellectual property protection and linkages between research and development and commercialisation\n",
      "· Targeting innovation initiatives at areas that have the potential to provide high impact in terms of value creation and job generation\n",
      "· Developing a framework to attract and retain talent in the country\n",
      "· Engaging the Diaspora and expanding the network of 'ambassadors' of Trinidad and Tobago\n",
      "· Establishing a comprehensive incentive programme to attract entrepreneurs and support incubators in Trinidad and Tobago\n",
      "· Promoting a stronger research effort that is supported by the re-orientation of education resources towards science-based learning and a rethinking of curriculum in alignment with market demand, the entrepreneurial imperative and the diversification thrust\n",
      "· Establishing mechanisms to link research efforts to commercial prospects and to industry innovation\n",
      "· Strengthening the capacity of the creative industries to contribute to economic growth\n",
      "8\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "Creating A New Growth Dynamic\n",
      "Widening and Deepening the Production Base and Building Production Clusters\n",
      "Promoting new and sustainable high value-added industries will strengthen the economy by creating new engines of growth. This effort must be accompanied by initiatives to increase the competitiveness and productivity of existing industries. In this regard, the opportunities for expanding and deepening the production base in existing industries and sectors will be explored in collaboration with the private sector. The Council for Competitiveness and Innovation (CCI) will lead the direct interface with industry required to action this.\n",
      "Additionally, diversification must be seen within a wider economic space, internally but moreso externally. High value production systems can be created by linking new and existing industries to form production clusters that maximise the potential for value creation.1 These production clusters consist of networks of inter-dependent firms linked to each other in value- added production chains. Firm linkages must be made for example among the agriculture, tourism, cultural and health industries, and between the energy and the green industry to maximise the potential for value-added and simultaneously meet global standards. The CCI will also play a supportive and facilitative role in this regard.\n",
      "Cluster development is already being promoted in the ICT industry through initiatives under the Evolving TecKnologies and Enterprise Development Company (e TecK). Over the medium-term, Government will explore the potential for regional cluster development, by partnering with resource-rich neighbouring countries in specific industries to produce globally competitive products.\n",
      "Developing Culture, Supporting Creative Industries\n",
      "The expansion and development of cultural industries offer vast potential for improving the growth trajectory and creating employment and wealth generating opportunities. Growth can be fuelled by creating the conditions in which artistic expression can be brought to the level of global excellence in the performing and visual arts, literary and fashion industries, architectural design and the software industries, among others. Creating an endogenous growth dynamic based on culture and creativity will mean not only promoting our world class artistes but also supporting sustainable livelihoods and expanding opportunities for visitors and tourists while\n",
      "1 Cluster development will allow for the exploitation of economies of scale and will encourage collabo- ration for innovation. This strategy has fostered the growth of high value-added industries in Mauritius and Singapore.\n",
      "9\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "developing and packaging new value-added activities to expand the range of products and services offered locally and internationally. The distinction must be made between cultural industries which are rooted in indigenous talent, the creativity and production that are part of our heritage and creative industries which seek to monetise creation effort and create profitable businesses.\n",
      "The Green Industry and Alternative Energy Sources\n",
      "Trinidad and Tobago must commence the process of transitioning to a low carbon society. As such, Government is committed to the development of a new growth dynamic that transforms the existing consumption-based economic growth into an environmentally-friendly one - a model that emphasises the efficient use of resources and minimises pollution by utilising environmentally-friendly technologies and supporting green industry.\n",
      "Reflecting the growing importance of green technology, Government will capitalise on the rising global interest in green growth and products, support green technology as a new growth engine and develop new industries that can successfully engage in the global environmentally- friendly technology market. Government will also explore avenues for creating a greener transportation system.\n",
      "An important element of the agenda involves taking into account environmental considerations when procuring goods and services, and avoiding activities such as the purchase of single-use disposable items.\n",
      "The development of alternative energy sources is another aspect of greening that will aid in diversification of the economy. Given the natural and geographic advantages of the country, the promotion of solar, wave and wind energy industries can potentially provide a new growth dynamic that will move the economy to a lower dependence on hydrocarbons and ensure increasing competitiveness in the changing global energy industry. Through the Economic Development Board (EDB) some of these strategic initiatives for diversification will be explored and pursued.\n",
      "Creating New Economic Spaces\n",
      "An important thrust of the economic and social transformation effort is the wider dispersion of productive activities across the country. In order to expand the economic space within the country, Government has identified five (5) growth poles for focussed attention. Four (4) of the designated areas are in Trinidad - Central, the South Western Peninsula, East Port of Spain\n",
      "10\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "and the North-Coast. The fifth growth pole is the North-East Region of Tobago. The chosen areas will benefit from a special package of fiscal incentives, including the granting of Free Trade Zone Status and will be allowed to access the tax incentives provided to the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Tourism Sectors. Specific growth initiatives also target Invader's Bay in Port of Spain, the Chaguaramas Peninsula, Tamana Intech Park, Cove Estate in Tobago and the Capital City of Port of Spain. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is funding consulting support for this effort.\n",
      "Creating Opportunities For Investment And Export Expansion - Ttbizlink Multi-Language Platform\n",
      "As part of its trade and investment strategy, Government will expand TTBizLink into several languages based on factors such as cultural linkages, geographical location, strategic impor- tance, and countries with market potential. The initiative will assist in the penetration of new export markets. Over the medium-term, a Multi-language Platform will be activated which will allow investors to access helpful links to Government and business services and informa- tion in six (6) languages other than English, namely Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French and Portuguese. This initiative is being driven by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).\n",
      "THE SOCIAL IMPERATIVES OF TRANSFORMING OUR SOCIETY\n",
      "Social and Economic Transformation Go Hand in Hand\n",
      "The process of economic transformation must occur simultaneously with social transformation and must not only involve strategic reform measures within the social sector, but on a deeper level, the transforming of values and attitudes.\n",
      "The areas targeted for reform in the social sphere are the social services including safety net programmes geared towards reducing poverty, the education and training system, the health system, regional and community development and housing and community creation.\n",
      "Values and Attitudes\n",
      "In terms of our values and attitudes, we need to inculcate a passion for lifelong learning among our citizenry, heighten our sense of civic responsibility as well as our commitment to nation building and place a premium on the value of productivity. This combination of reforms within specific areas of our social system and the positive changes in our values and attitudes will have a catalytic effect on the economic transformation effort. The transformation will, there- fore, comprise not only infrastructural, legislative, policy, programme/project reforms, which\n",
      "11\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "are tangible in nature, but the intangible aspects of development - that of our national psyche. The ultimate goal is to create an equitable, inclusive society, in which 'everyone counts' and everyone can enjoy an improved quality of life but where there is also respect for human life and meritorious achievement and where value is placed on positive human interaction, social engagement and community building.\n",
      "Stepping Out of Poverty\n",
      "In order to lift persons out of poverty, as opposed to reinforcing a culture of dependency, social safety net programmes will be designed and structured using a developmental approach, better targeted, and with clear exit strategies. Conditionalities for cash as well as training compo- nents of make-work programmes such as the Community-Based Environmental Protection and Enhancement Programme (CEPEP) will be implemented. The restructuring of CEPEP has already commenced. These reform measures coupled with a desire for lifelong learning, will encourage citizens to advance towards better paying jobs through education and training thereby creating greater equity. A similar approach is being taken towards the Unemployment Relief Programme (URP), which is currently being restructured, refocused and diversified.\n",
      "Education for Opportunity and Freedom\n",
      "It is, therefore, imperative that the changes to our social programmes be supported by a strong education system, one which must be made seamless and relevant to our development needs. In addition to focusing on improving the success rate at secondary schools and diversifying the curriculum, Government will continue to increase the number of Workforce Assessment Cen- tres, develop a Labour Market Information System (LMIS), strengthen and refocus its training strategy as well as review its scholarship programme. These initiatives will enable citizens to reintegrate into the education and training system and assist in the alignment with the absorp- tive capacity of the labour market. Increased education and participation in the economy will not only foster feelings of inclusion among citizens but will increase productivity as well.\n",
      "As part of the social transformation thrust, the education system will be reformed with the emphasis on curricula reform, teacher training, the adoption of new teaching methodologies as well as the infusion of technology in the learning process. Government's laptop programme (eConnect and Learn-eCAL) serves as a key example of the importance of incorporating new ways of learning and promoting technology adaptation among the youth. These reforms will instill some of the required values and attitudes necessary for national development. The goal is also to develop the will and skill of our citizens thereby building our human capital - one of the key elements required for establishing a National Innovation System. Education will sup-\n",
      "12\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "port the greater freedom of the citizen as economic and social transformation takes place and new opportunities become visible.\n",
      "A Healthier Nation\n",
      "A socially transformed Trinidad and Tobago will also comprise a health system that is of the highest standard and which emphasises preventative medicine. This is to ensure that citizens have access to quality health care and are less prone to health problems, in particular, non-com- municable diseases (NCDs). By promoting healthy lifestyles and providing effective, quality health care, citizens are physically and mentally able to produce and excel. There will also be the added benefit of reducing the current financial burden on our health system. Through the upgrade and expansion of hospitals and Enhanced Health Facilities, Government's Chronic Disease Risk Factor Screening Campaign, its mobile clinics as well as the establishment of a Tobacco Control Unit, these reforms will be achieved.\n",
      "Consulting the Citizen\n",
      "In order to promote citizen participation and citizens' rights, decisions will be based on con- sultation and consensus building where these impact directly on the citizen and on commu- nities. Furthermore, in keeping with Government's commitment to economic inclusiveness and 'Prosperity for All', resources will be allocated equitably in support of balanced regional development. These are the primary reasons for Government's solicitation of Regional Devel- opment Plans based on community input. This approach recognises the vision, strength, skills and resources that reside within communities. It is based on greater collaboration amongst social partners: government, business, labour and civil society to establish the basis for social capital rebuilding. This model of development will also be applied in the five (5) growth poles identified by Government.\n",
      "Planning for Sustainable Communities\n",
      "While promoting development based on citizen participation and inclusion, sound develop- ment planning as well as gender mainstreaming will also be taken into account. Government has already conducted consultations within five (5) communities on its Land Use Policy for these specific districts and more communities will be involved. Moreover, the National Land Use Policy is currently being drafted.\n",
      "In relation to the housing sector, housing settlements will be so designed that sustainable com- munities including avenues for attractive business opportunities and community coherence will be promoted. Infrastructural development including public transport, public spaces and\n",

      "buildings will widely accommodate and include marginalised groups such as the elderly and the differently-abled. Already, through Government's Home Improvement Grants Programme, differently-abled persons have been specifically targeted to benefit.\n",
      "Greater Self-Reliance and Prosperity for All\n",
      "The social transformation coupled with the economic transformation measures will serve to positively impact upon our socio-economic problems such as crime, poverty and inequity. Citizens will also come to possess the wherewithal for future development. Our strategy is therefore, to create more wealth, to diversify, to include all with the will to participate, to spread wealth gaining opportunities, to strengthen the culture and spirit of entrepreneurship and self-reliance and to usher in an era of prosperity for all.\n",
      "EFFECTING THE TRANSFORMATION IN A SPATIAL CONTEXT\n",
      "Planning for the Economy, Supporting Enlightened Development Practices Physical planning shapes the country we live in and, therefore, the environment in which the economic and social transformation will take place. It is vital for the spatial articulation of socio-economic and environmental goals and for achieving sustainable outcomes. Successful implementation of plans and policies must be linked to a system of planning that is transpar- ent, inclusive, and responsive while ensuring the sustainability of development. In Trinidad and Tobago, physical planning is governed by the Town and Country Planning Act, (Chapter 35:01) which was proclaimed in 1969. Recognising that there are deficiencies in its current ad- ministration, legislation will be introduced shortly that will significantly alter the way in which planning will be undertaken.\n",
      "Through the proposed legislation - the Planning and Development of Land (PADL) Bill, the ministerial model of accountability to Parliament will be maintained but there will be substan- tial delegation of powers. Amongst the provisions of the PADL Bill are the establishment of a Multi-stakeholder Planning Commission; delegation of development planning and develop- ment control to Municipal Corporations; integration and coordination of planning and building approvals at the municipal level; establishment of a statutory \"Chief Building Inspectorate\" at the level of the Commission, to provide a technical oversight function to the Municipal Cor- porations; provision of a \"One-stop Shop\" of statutory agencies involved in the development regulatory regime, and, the creation of a statutory appeal process to replace the current ad hoc procedures of appeals to the Minister.\n",
      "14\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "A Task Force has been appointed to undertake the technical review and provide support and advice for the updating of the PADL Bill which was last revised in 2001. It is expected that this Bill will be laid in Parliament by the end of 2011.\n",
      "In 1984, the first National Physical Development Plan (NPDP) became statutory, meaning that it prescribed how all land in Trinidad and Tobago was to be used and provided the broad policy framework within which more detailed regional and local area plans were to be prepared to guide development. Since that time, the physical landscape has changed considerably, brought on by population growth and changes in the country's development thrusts while competing demands for the country's limited land resources have become more critical. There is now an undeniably urgent need to prepare a new NPDP. To this end, the Task Force has also been mandated to make recommendations on the process of reviewing the NPDP. Preliminary work has commenced within the Town and Country Planning Division with a view to having it com- pleted by September 2012.\n",
      "The role of physical planning must be seen as more than simply land use and building controls. It must extend to the shaping of liveable and inclusive communities, city centres and towns, economic spaces, the natural environment and the design and location of physical infrastruc- ture. In this regard, it must balance socio-economic priorities with environmental limits and constraints and promote a pattern of development that is environmentally sustainable and so- cially just.\n",
      "In addition to physical planning and a land use policy, in consultation with key stakeholders, a Building Code will be established to ensure adherence to construction standards in Trinidad and Tobago that are meaningful and enforceable.\n",
      "SUSTAINING THE TRANSFORMATION\n",
      "The Importance of the Environment\n",
      "At the core of our social and economic development strategy lies a fundamental respect for the environment. Recognising the importance of balancing social and economic transformation with environmental conservation, the pivotal shift to 'green' policy planning will guarantee environmental security for future generations.\n",
      "Protecting and conserving our natural resources is critical to advancing economic development and improving our quality of life. We must maintain a balance in economic activity that uses\n",

      "our resources as productively as possible to provide the greatest possible socio-economic ben- efits. Maintaining the equilibrium between economic activity and the provision of social ser- vices requires adherence to a legislative and policy framework that governs the management of renewable and non-renewable environmental resources. Therefore, updating the National Environmental Policy to incorporate all recent international commitments will strengthen Trinidad and Tobago's obligation to the global community and enhance the consistency and integrity of policy and execution at home.\n",
      "Increasing the productivity and economic contribution of each sector cannot be isolated from environmental stewardship. Finalising draft legislation such as the Air Pollution Rules, the Solid and Hazardous Waste Rules and the Beverage Container Bill will ensure that companies and industries claim their responsibility for the protection of the environment and are fully aware of the consequences. Encouraging industries and companies to reduce their carbon foot- print; increase their efficiency and conduct energy audits will also assist in this effort. Steps will also be taken to ensure that quarrying activities do not negatively impact water courses.\n",
      "Meeting the challenge of satisfying the demands of a growing population for housing, schools and other supportive infrastructure requires collaborative efforts to ensure that resources are used efficiently. The new Land Use Policy will facilitate development in a coherent and sus- tainable manner that clearly identifies land use through zoning of agricultural, commercial, residential and conservatory spaces. Conservation of our environment to secure the needs of future generations will be expanded through the amendment of the Green Fund legislation to include the restoration of areas that have been damaged by poor environmental practices. It will also allow Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) access to the Fund for reforestation and conservation purposes. The country's biological resources will be conserved for future generations through new administrative arrangements for their management namely the imple- mentation of the National Parks and Recreation Authority. The setting up of the Authority will protect environmentally sensitive areas while simultaneously creating green spaces for recre- ational activities thus enhancing the quality of life of citizens.\n",

      "gases in the atmosphere. In spite of its minuscule absolute greenhouse gas emissions, Trinidad and Tobago is committed to playing its part as a responsible member of the global community. Towards this end, the Government has adopted a Climate Change Policy, the implementation of which will increase the use of new and innovative technologies that have lower levels of emissions; encourage the use of clean energy technology and renewable energy; and, promote the adoption of more energy-efficient technologies and practices. The adoption of the National Climate Change Policy now sets the stage for Trinidad and Tobago to implement action with respect to mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Over the medium-term, the Govern- ment will undertake the following initiatives:\n",
      "· The 'Greening' of the Priority Bus Route through the conversion of street lights and traffic lights to use solar power and the deployment of electric passenger buses where economically feasible\n",
      "· Mainstreaming of the climate policy into the national development policy framework\n",
      "· Outfitting of the police surveillance bays along the Churchill Roosevelt Highway with green technology such as solar lighting\n",
      "Within the upcoming fiscal year, the Government aims to become a 'green business' in order to do its part to support the conservation of the environment. As such, a Green Government Policy will be developed to enable the reduction of critical financial resources in terms of Government operations by reducing consumables and the use of energy. Towards this end, the Government will begin the 'greening' of its operations through using recycled paper at all Government offices and double sided printing and photocopying where possible; and ensuring that all buildings procured for Government offices by the Properties and Real Estate Division are equipped with green technologies such as lighting fixtures with energy efficient bulbs; wa- ter saving devices on taps and toilets; and air conditioning and fire extinguishing systems that do not use ozone depleting gases.\n",
      "Being Prepared for Disaster, Managing Risk\n",
      "While the implementation of land use policies will facilitate appropriate land use, the impact of natural disasters on the economic growth of a country can have dire consequences. As such, Government will strengthen this country's capacity not only to deal with emergency response and reconstructive measures but also increase and improve preventative measures where di- saster can be avoided. Instilling a culture of safety, public education and awareness while ad- dressing comprehensive disaster risk management will be guided by a Comprehensive Disaster Management Policy Framework.\n",

An Inter-Ministerial Committee to address the issues of flooding and drainage, established in the second quarter of 2010, will spearhead this effort.\n",
      "Good and Effective Governance\n",
      "The transformation effort will be guided and fortified by the tenets of good and effective gov- ernance. Government will ensure that 'the Voice of the People' is heard and taken into account through a participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, equitable and inclusive process that follows the rule of law. Soliciting comments from the individual, the family, the community and the wider population will effectively ensure direct citizen participa- tion. Enabling citizens to make contributions and recommendations through the establishment of an internet portal, 'E-view' will act as a facilitator.\n",
      "Labour and Civil Society\n",
      "Ensuring effective representation that reflects the views of the population requires the involve- ment of, labour and civil society. The Economic Development Board and the Civil Society Board (CSB) will be the main instruments for the involvement of the population on key deci- sions related to the national sustainable development agenda.\n",
      "Strategic Plans of Ministries\n",
      "In the area of transparency and accountability, Government will ensure that Ministries and De- partments prepare and implement Strategic Plans and submit periodic reports to Parliament on their activities. Ministers will be held accountable for the performance of their Ministries and ensure timely submission of annual reports to the relevant Joint Select Committee. Priority will also be given to reforming the public procurement process and measures are to be undertaken to give effect to the recommendations contained in the White Paper on Reforming the Public Sector Procurement Regime.\n",
      "Strengthening the operations of public institutions is a key focal point for the Government. A major contributor to improving the effectiveness of the Public Service lies in its ability to develop and institutionalise mechanisms that allow for the development of clear policy direc- tions from the Centre of Government and the alignment of the plans and programmes of all Ministries and Departments with these centrally developed guidelines.\n",

      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "Results Framework\n",
      "Government will adopt a collaborative approach to decision making in cross functional areas as it relates to the articulation of centrally developed guidelines, through the increased utilisa- tion of inter-ministerial committees and working groups. Parallel to this is the need for greater emphasis on a results-oriented, customer/client focused Public Service that garners a culture of respect and a commitment to performance. Transforming Local Government services through the devolution of authority from Ministries to ensure increased efficiency and impact will be undertaken. Creating an environment that motivates and transforms the Public Service into a model for effective service delivery is also crucial.\n",
      "PRIORITIES FOR ACTION OVER THE MEDIUM-TERM\n",
      "In the context of the economic and social transformation envisaged, the following are identi- fied as priorities for action in the first medium-term planning horizon (2011-2014):\n",
      "1. Strengthening of the national database and information management system to influ- ence national policy choices and to support evidence based decision making. This in- cludes a comprehensive re-organisation of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and a more strategic harnessing and deployment of resources;\n",
      "2. Completion of a comprehensive national land use policy in 2012, even as the land use policy for specific regions of Trinidad and Tobago are rolled out to support commu- nity development initiatives and objectives and the national sustainable development agenda. This will include reform of the Town and Country Planning Division and a comprehensive land development bill for Parliament; and\n",
      "3. Alignment of Ministerial agendas for high impact within the framework of the sustain- able development strategy outlined in this Medium-term Policy Framework 2011-2014 and in keeping with the seven (7) interconnected pillars of government policy.\n",
      "These three (3) items above taken together will have a major impact on the shift in policy re- quired to put Trinidad and Tobago on a sustainable development trajectory.\n",
      "In addition, there will be concentrated focus, intensive effort and strategic interventions in order to effect the shift in policy required to create a safe society, a diversified economy, invest- ment, entrepreneurial initiatives and growth with jobs.\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "19\n",
      "The areas identified for concentrated attention over the medium-term are:\n",
      "1. Crime reduction and containment, and improvement of the general environment for safety and security. This is essential for its own sake but also important for establishing the confidence level required for increased economic activity and creation of a new, more diversified economy;\n",
      "2. Food security through development of the agricultural sector. This is a major area of emphasis in a volatile commodities market and will be the bedrock of greater national self-sufficiency which will lead to revitalisation of the farming and food production sectors;\n",
      "3. (a) Job creation through investment and diversification and by building a more productive and competitive economy. This will be achieved through diversification within the energy sector and through growth of services and creative industries, and the tourism and agricultural sectors by fresh initiatives taken in the five (5) growth poles to create new economic spaces and diversified investment across the country.\n",
      "(b) A highly targeted, geographically dispersed PSIP with projects selected on the basis of four (4) principles: (i) alignment with the seven (7) interconnected pillars; (ii) impact on people and communities; (iii) geographical distribution; and (iv) alignment of PSIP portfolio with national priorities;\n",
      "4. Well managed hospitals and a better quality health service to all our citizens across the country with specific actions for expansion of facilities and construction of new hospitals;\n",
      "5. Achievement of a poverty reduction target of two (2) per cent per year and improvement of the equity gap through a range of measures to promote economic and financial sustainability;\n",
      "6. Alignment between national priorities, regional priorities within the 14 local government jurisdictions and the House of Assembly in Tobago and the 585 communities identified throughout Trinidad and Tobago; and\n",
      "7. Building a growth momentum which will demand the dedicated effort of Government, private sector, workers and civil society. Notwithstanding the challenges and uncertainties, Government will pursue a growth target of 2 per cent in 2011-2012. Given the uncertainties of the international environment, it is difficult to make projections beyond 2012 with any certainty. But the focus of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago over the next three (3) years will be growth, job creation, competitiveness and inovation.\n",
      "20\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "In addition, the Government will strive for 90 per cent fulfilment of our obligations under each area of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in this medium-term planning period as we move towards full achievement of the targets by 2015.\n",
      "Encouraging meaningful participation requires reducing the structural inequities that lead to inequitable access to the factors that contribute to enhanced income generating opportunities which perpetuate a cycle of poverty including education and training, and opportunities for self-determination.\n",
      "The State has a critical role to play in setting the stage for such meaningful participation by ensuring that the economic development path chosen is inclusive and involves the participation of the widest cross section of the population by creating the right environment. The ultimate objective is to create a sense of belonging and ensure the basic minimum needs of the population are met which allows individuals to aspire to higher levels of self-actualisation.\n",
      "In this respect, significant interventions will include the reduction of regional disparities by investing in basic infrastructure, including housing and amenities and opportunities for investment that create an environment for sustainable communities, incorporating 'green' principles into the design of living spaces. In this regard, five (5) growth poles have been identified for development.\n",
      "The mainstreaming of gender into development planning will allow the differential impacts of programmes and projects on women and men to be assessed and targeted initiatives implemented to assist them to effectively participate in economic activities and raise their families out of the poverty cycle. Government will continue to reform relevant legislation to promote gender equality. A concerted effort will also be made to increase the number of women holding high level decision making positions within the State Sector.\n",
      "The promotion of wellness through the health system and individual responsibility for personal health will lead to an improved quality of life and reduce the burden on the health system and allow individuals to live more productively.\n",
      "Apart from the more tangible benefits of education, a renewed effort will focus on rebuilding a good work ethic that breeds a spirit of excellence, civic responsibility incorporated into the school curriculum and creating a disciplined society with a sense of national pride in Trinidad and Tobago.\n",

It places a premium on creating high value jobs and generating wealth across all regions of the country. The thrust is towards building an innovative, highly skilled work force supported by strong institutions and increased research and development activity as the cornerstones of the economic restructuring effort.\n",

      "POLICY SHIFTS\n",
      "In the context of the seven (7) Development Pillars and the priorities identified for the medium- term, Government has begun the process of initiating several policy shifts.\n",
      "Foremost among them is the movement towards building a new economy that is capable of generating high levels of productivity-led, innovation-driven endogenous economic growth. The new economy will not be dominated by the continued exploitation of natural resources or production of primary products which are subject to the vagaries of global developments, but instead, will be based on the knowledge, skill, talent and enterprise of our human capital and their engagement in productive activities higher up the value chain. In restructuring the economy, the emphasis will be on expanding the services sector, spurring the development of the knowledge and creative sectors especially in niche segments with the potential for building competitiveness, greater adaptation and use of technology, and innovation that is driven by indigenous knowledge and expanded research and development activity. In terms of immediate actions, priority is being given to building quality human capital, addressing the factors limiting competitiveness, creating new growth centres across the country, encouraging investment in knowledge industries and establishing the infrastructure for a National Innovation System.\n",
      "The second main policy shift is linked to the first. Government is committed to the creation\n",
      "24\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "of a more inclusive and cohesive society in which there is greater equity in the distribution of resources. In this effort, the issue of the quality of the jobs created and the opportunities that exist for wealth generation as opposed to income generation only, are not insignificant departures from past policy initiatives. The goal is to break the cycle of poverty through more meaningful economic participation. Government is therefore giving priority to education and skills training that are aligned to the needs of the new economy and the creation of expanded opportunities for high-paying jobs, small and micro-enterprise development and wealth generation and accumulation.\n",
      "The third significant shift is the decisive move by Government to have greater people partici- pation in the decision making process. This shift will give widespread legitimacy to the eco- nomic and social transformation that is underway and will advance the goal of creating more meaningful inclusiveness and cohesion in the society.\n",
      "The other major policy shifts involve new approaches to planning and decision-making in the country. The point to be made is that socio-economic transformation and sustainable develop- ment will not be achieved in the absence of good planning. The new approaches fall under the direction and co-ordination of the Ministry of Planning and the Economy and involve:\n",
      "· Strenghtening the national statistics and information systems that will enable policy design and decision making to be data-driven and evidence-based. The reform of the Central Statistical Office and the incorporation of satellite data collection agencies within the National Statistics System are being accorded high priority\n",
      "· Creating and adopting a life cycle-based analytical framework for addressing the needs of the population. In keeping with the principles of 'Prosperity for All' and 'Everyone Counts', the strategy is to focus planning efforts on the needs of: (i) each individual member of the family at each stage of his/her life cycle; (ii) the collective family unit; (iii) each community; and (iv) each Region of the country. This approach will be particularly effective in breaking the cycle of poverty, especially for children, young adults, women and communities and in creating specifically targeted opportunities for socio-economic advancement\n",

      "Crime continues to be one of our country's formidable challenges. In recent opinion surveys of the population, crime, law and order and vandalism have been ranked consistently as the number one issue facing the country. It is a problem that affects individuals psychologically; communities are shattered and debilitated by it and as a national problem it undermines the ability of the State to provide safety and security for citizens.\n",

      "· Improve coordination among the various social sector agencies and create stronger partnerships with communities (education) to reduce the desire and opportunity for crime and the odds of becoming a victim\n",
      "Although the number of murders declined from a historic high of 547 in 2008, to 473 last year, the situation remains unacceptable. A very high number of serious crimes was also recorded annually in the period 2008-2010. Serious crimes increased from 20,566 in 2008 to 21,933 in 2009 before declining to 19,918 in 2010. The majority of the murders and other serious crimes were committed in the Northern, Eastern and Western areas of Trinidad. The average detection rate for serious crimes and murders was 16.2 per cent and 19.8 per cent, respectively. The current situation adversely affects the safety of citizens, their families, and communities. Foreign investments, investor confidence and consequently economic growth are also negatively affected. The culture of fear which has emerged over the last decade, and which is stifling all aspects of development - recreation, culture and business - cannot be allowed to continue. It was in this context that a State of Emergency was declared to contain and accelerate the process to eventually reverse the situation.\n",

These are to be supported by national strategies for economic recovery, growth and expansion which will create jobs, foster greater economic inclusion and move us in the direction of achieving prosperity for all.\n",
      "Strategy: Strengthen Law Enforcement and Law Enforcement Agencies\n",
      "As crime and criminal activity become more complex, priority is being given to increasing the sophistication of the resources and systems utilised and to the effective management of Law Enforcement Agencies. As such, emphasis is being placed on expanding the use of modern technology for tracking crime and ensuring connectivity between law enforcement agencies, capacity building and training of law enforcement officers, as well as the modernisation of physical infrastructure and information management systems.\n",
      "A major initiative is the 21st Century Policing Project, which introduces a new delivery system for policing that builds partnerships with communities and provides a high level of customer service. It effectively blends intelligence led proactive initiatives together with community policing strategies. Given the success of the pilot, it is being incorporated into the other eight (8) Divisions of the Police Service.\n",
      "Efforts are also underway to redouble the training capacity of the Police Academy, to allow for increased recruit intake and advanced training. In addition to the expansion of the Recruiting Unit to include 20 Background Check Investigators and more Polygraphists, the Induction Programme has been revised, the Induction Facility enhanced and plans are underway to expand the facilities to support the proposed increased intake and ensure suitable accommodation for all programmes.\n",
      "Additionally, to provide greater focus and expertise to policing, specialised units such as Divisional Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) Units and Domestic Violence and Special Victims Units are being established. As part of the strategy for the timely provision of forensic pathology and analytical laboratory services to support law enforcement and the administration of justice, a new state-of-the-art Forensic Centre will be constructed and properly equipped.\n",

      "· Target leaders and criminals involved in gangs, guns and drugs to rescue communities\n",
      "· Seek out guns and ammunition that support criminal activity and take them out of circulation\n",
      "· Target businesses that are aligned to criminal activity and that provide cover for crime and criminal activities\n",

      "Strategy: Strengthen the Legal Framework\n",
      "A very important aspect of reducing crime relates to evidence gathering from informants and creating the necessary facilitating environment for the testimony of victims and witnesses, and the appropriate legislative framework for effective law enforcement and the proper punishment of offenders.\n",
      "Several pieces of key legislation have either been assented to or proclaimed, namely:\n",
      "· The Anti-Gang Act which makes provision for the suppression of associations established for unlawful purposes\n",
      "· The Bail (Amendment) Act which confers on a Court the jurisdiction to deny bail to a person who is a gang member\n",
      "· The Miscellaneous Provisions (Kidnapping and Bail) Act, which increases the amount of time a person can be held with no evidence for the charge of kidnapping and changes the existing penalty for the offence of kidnapping\n",
      "· The Interception of Communications Act, which provides the legal framework within which public or private communications, which are being transmitted by means of a public or private telecommunications network, can be lawfully intercepted\n",
      "· The Firearms Amendment Act, which provides for the increase in penalties for offences involving a firearm or any prohibited weapon, as defined by the Act, by an average of 50 per cent\n",

      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      ". The Trafficking in Persons Act, which gives effect to the United Nations (UN) Protocol to prevent and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and for connected matters\n",
      "· The Miscellaneous Provisions (Remand) Act, which increases the period in which a Magistrate can remand an accused person with regard to both summary and indictable matters, thereby reducing the frequency of court hearings, the time in taking prisoners to and from court, and the costs associated therewith\n",
      "In recognition of the transnational and perverse financing of crime, the Financial Intelligence Act (2009) has been amended to improve the effectiveness of the Financial Intelligence Unit in combating money laundering as well as terrorist financing in Trinidad and Tobago.\n",
      "To combat the growing fear and mistrust that the law cannot protect citizens, the problem of witness intimidation and gang code of silence, the Government will therefore, revisit the issue of enacting the necessary legislation that will allow for using existing technology to record statements of both accused persons and witnesses, even where the latter is absent at the trial, and making such evidence admissible in Court.\n",
      "In the new fiscal year, legislation will be brought to Parliament for the Private Security Industry and to amend the Prison Rules and the Defence Act as well as the Evidence Act.\n",
      "Strategy: Construct 21st Century Facilities for Law Enforcement\n",
      "The working environment of law enforcement agents is a major determinant in successful detection and policing. Officers require working conditions and amenities such as evidence docks and interview rooms to effectively discharge their responsibilities while the public needs accessible and appropriate facilities to interact with law enforcement personnel. In an effort to provide officers with modern accommodation and amenities, the State will construct 19 police stations at various locations throughout Trinidad and Tobago. All property rooms will be outfitted with the technology to ensure that all items in Police care will be properly labelled and accounted for. A major project is the construction of new and modern, purpose built facilities to expand the Police Training Academy in St. James. Government will also undertake construction of Coast Guard facilities in strategic locations and upgrade of the Maximum Security Prison Complex.\n",

In addition, the establishment of a Central Booking System will result in the introduction of new and more effective procedures for booking, case management and prosecution. Two critical initiatives will have a significant impact on efforts to maintain law and order - the complete automation of Police Administration which will permit the elimination of the paper based system and the establishment of a National Security Operations Centre with the capacity to conduct real time tracking of crime and criminal activity.\n",
      "Strategy: Strengthen Surveillance and Control of Borders\n",
      "Initiatives to stem illegal activity across our land borders must be complemented by actions that reduce security threats in our airspace and maritime domains. Priority attention is being given to improving mobility and rapid deployment to quickly counter and interdict based on shifts in smuggling routes and tactical intelligence and to improving border awareness and intelligence. To effectively safeguard the nation's maritime borders, greater scrutiny will be placed on containers, cruise ships and ferries as part of a comprehensive, systematic approach to border security. This will include the application of international best practice to increase container inspections at foreign ports, which requires carriers to submit a complete cargo mani- fest at least 24 hours prior to loading for vessels that are calling directly on local ports. Key initiatives include the strengthening of the Coast Guard fleet by the acquisition of 12 intercep- tors, the sourcing of two (2) long range patrol vessels and the addition of two (2) helicopters to the fleet of the Air Guard.\n",

      "Despite the best efforts of the justice apparatus, many persons reoffend, thus resulting in criti- cal State resources being deployed and utilised to address the consequences of recidivism. To reduce the prevalence of persistent reoffending, inmates will be given more opportunities to excel and become productive members of society. Programmes will be implemented to help inmates learn new skills and develop good habits and attitudes to facilitate reintegration into society. Among the actions to be taken are:\n",
      "· Increase inmate basic skills and provide them with the opportunity to work towards educational qualifications, and vocational and industry-recognised certification in or- der to improve their future employment prospects\n",

      "Food Security is a major goal of the Government. The objective is to develop a highly productive agricultural sector that is modernised and internationally competitive and that generates sustainable income levels for producers comparable to those obtained in other sectors of the economy. The Sector must enhance our country's renewable resources and biodiversity and BOX 4: Agriculture and Food Security - Medium-term Objectives meet the needs of the population for adequate supplies of locally grown, affordable and nutritious food.\n",
      "Food security is a complex sustainable development issue. It is linked to health through malnutrition and chronic diseases; poverty eradication; research and development (R&D); sustainable economic development; environmental conservation; and the trade balance. Food security \"exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food\" (Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), 1996).\n",
      "· Reduce the food import bill (Target: 10% annually)\n",
      "· Reduce the rate of food inflation and sustain it within single digits\n",
      "· Create sustainable, long-term productive employment in the sector to support a national unemployment level that is under 7%\n",
      "Increase the sector's contribution to GDP (Target: 3% by 2014)\n",
      ". Create a food secure nation\n",
      "The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has predicted that the demand for food will increase by 50 per cent by 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050.3 To meet this rising demand, it is imperative that countries develop a thriving and viable agriculture sector that will form the foundation for becoming food secure by 2050. Nevertheless, attaining national food security is not without its challenges, especially given factors such as changes in the global climate and population; economic, social and environmental sustainability; and the evolution of world- wide markets and distribution mechanisms. The agriculture sector in Trinidad and Tobago comprises production, processing and marketing activities in the crop, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors. The contribution of domestic agriculture to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2010 was 0.4 per cent4, and although the sector accounts for only 3.5 per cent5 of employment , it provides employment to many persons and families in rural areas.\n",

      "The food import bill has almost doubled in the last five (5) years from approximately $2.7 billion in 2006 to almost $4 billion in 2010.6 This trend is indicative of the country's high dependence on foreign food supplies which include some of the basic staples such as cereals, rice and corn.\n",
      "The challenges facing the local agriculture sector include seasonality and natural disasters (such as flooding); low skills; praedial larceny; land tenure, scarcity of labour and an aging farming population. More specifically, some of the key challenges that affect the cost, quality and level of production within the sector include:\n",
      "1. Poor agricultural practices and low levels of technology use;\n",
      "2. Inadequate Infrastructure - poor access roads, water resource management and drainage systems;\n",
      "3. Limited quality and quantity of land designated for agricultural purposes; and\n",
      "4. Delays in farmer regularisation on State lands.\n",
      "In spite of these challenges, agriculture is a viable option for diversification. The surge in demand for food globally coupled with the low levels of food stocks in developed countries, adverse global climatic conditions and high energy prices are factors that give rise to the need to revitalise the sector. Increased investment is therefore required. Successful expansion of agricultural exports will encourage existing farmers to expand their operations and encourage investment in the sector. Agriculture for export has the potential to generate jobs, as well as strengthen entrepreneurship within the sector. Movement of resources from traditional agricultural activities to research, development and employment of new production methods, as well as exports of non-traditional commodities will contribute to the growth of the sector. Increased usage of locally produced raw materials in the value chain approach will also be an important aspect of this shift in the industry.\n",

      "The quality of public health care services and the management of hospitals continue to be a main concern of the citizens of this country. Government recognises that in de- livering first class health care to citizens, the image of the public health system must be improved. This requires efficient, well man- aged hospitals that are capable of delivering health care services in accordance with global standards. Critical to this effort, is collaboration amongst all stakeholders within the health system.\n",
      "Disturbing trends in the health profile of the population indicate that Chronic Non- Communicable Diseases (CNCDs), infant and maternal mortality and some infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS are a cause for concern. The widening of the skills gap for professionals in medical and support servic- es and a deteriorating public image of the health sector accelerate the gravity of these existing issues.\n",
      "The incidence of diabetes and hypertension in Trinidad and Tobago has grown by approximately 68 per cent and 158 per cent between 1990 and 20067, respectively. These and other CNCDs (heart disease and cancer) account for four (4) out of the five (5) leading causes of death in the country. Human capital losses as a re- sult of the direct (cost of medical care in terms of prevention) and indirect (loss of productivity as a result of premature mortality and morbidity) costs of treating with these diseases increase the strain on public expenditure and pose a serious threat if preventative measures are not ag- gressively put in place to reverse this trend.\n",

      "Addressing dengue which is now endemic requires effort on the part of both citizens and Gov- ernment. The number of reported dengue cases increased from 401 cases in 2005 to 4,733 cases in 2010. Despite the marginal number of deaths associated with dengue fever, con- trolling the vector population through educational awareness targeting source reduction and strengthened surveillance will reduce the burden on the health system.\n",
      "Reducing child mortality rates to single digit figures remains a challenge as infant mortality, neo - natal and peri-natal mortality rates fluctuated above 10 per 1,000 live births over the pe- riod 1999-2006.8 Addressing the importance of nutrition, child health practices such as immu- nization, increasing the availability of trained and specialist medical personnel, improved hos- pital standards and increased pre and post natal care through maternal education programmes will aid in reducing these rates.\n",
      "Moreover, as the country continues to grapple with curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS, statistics reveal that the incidence of new cases remains high. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is not only a health issue but an economic one that poses a serious threat to national development efforts. The economic impact at 2009 was estimated at $41.25 million. The cost to treat one person with HIV for one year is approximately $14,000 and it is estimated that as at the end of 2009 there were approximately 21,636 people infected with the HIV virus with approximately four (4) new infections per day.9 The number of reported new HIV positive cases has remained consistent from 2005 to 2008 at 1,453 and 1,450 cases respectively with a small decline in 2009 at 1,384 cases.10 Since 2004, the incidence of HIV has been higher among females than males in all age groups. Young people in the age group 25-34 years, have been most affected, recording the highest cumulative cases of HIV infection. In relation to gender, females in the 15-29 year age group constitute the group with the higher incidence of HIV infection.11\n",
      "Combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic will require a collaborative effort from the Government, private sector and civil society to reduce the incidence of HIV and improve the levels of treat- ment and care for people living with HIV (PLWHIV). In that regard, a programme of action is being proposed consisting of coordinated activities to increase awareness and effect behav- ioural change in terms of safer sexual practices and reproductive health. The implementation of such activities would focus primarily on the areas of prevention and treatment.\n",

      "The growth trajectory of Trinidad and Tobago's economy is limited given its current structure and the low levels of productivity and competitiveness of many sectors. Growth continues to be driven by the energy sector as diversification efforts over the last decade have had minimal success. As a result, the economy does not exhibit either the internal dynamism to engage globally in the non- energy sectors or the capacity to generate meaningful jobs and wealth creating opportunities.\n",
      "The reality is that global dynamics have rapidly dismantled and redefined the traditional growth model that drives economic development and the basis for building competitive advantage. The new growth model emphasises export expansion, innovation in productive activities and the adaptation and use of modern technology. Mass production has been supplanted by mass customisation based on the use of IT and a focus on product design.\n",

      "In recent times, Trinidad and Tobago has weathered the global economic crisis well, relative to other Caribbean and small developing countries and macroeconomic conditions are now stable with real GDP growth projected at two (2) per cent in 2011/2012. Yet, there are some persistent problems that remain which must be addressed in the context of a new economic strategy.\n",
      "We clearly lag behind in terms of the robustness of the economy, competitiveness, productivity and innovation. The agriculture sector has been in continuous decline while the tourism sector has not developed the niche products on which it can build and sustain a competitive advantage. Although the Services Sector has seen some growth, there has been little diversification into high value services. The country also faces deficiencies in terms of the quality and relevance of the education system and tertiary education participation, while rising, is still below the requirements for creating a knowledge economy and the challenge of producing entrepreneurs and diversifying the economy fast enough to absorb increased throughput from the tertiary sector remains. In addition, there has been little or no attempt in the past to develop a comprehensive workforce development strategy. This has resulted in a capacity problem where 20 per cent of the workforce is classified as unskilled. Furthermore, based on the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), Trinidad and Tobago's ranking has shown no notable improvements, moving from a rank of 84 out of 139 countries in the 2010/2011 Report to 81 out of 142 countries in the 2011/2012 Report. In addition, given the size of our country, our GDP, and the level of spending on human development, our ranking of 59 on the Human Development Index (HDI) indicates that compared to similar countries, our spending is not as well targeted as it needs to be and that, if it were, our ranking could be higher.\n",
      "These global developments coupled with the structural rigidities, and competitive and innovation deficiencies in the domestic economy and declining hydrocarbon resources have created a sense of urgency to change the construct and engine of the Trinidad and Tobago economy. The goal of the Government is to build an economy that is capable of generating endogenous growth based on innovation, the generation and use of knowledge, higher productivity levels and export expansion in order to create wider opportunities for high paying jobs at all levels.\n",

It is also an essential pre-requisite for the growth and expansion of competitive firms that have the capacity to create high income jobs. In the face of depressed international economic conditions and global forecasts for a continuing slow recovery, the economy of Trinidad and Tobago remains in a relatively stable and strong position. There are warning signs now (October 2011) about stagnation and possible deeper recession than previously anticipated. This will ultimately have an effect on our economy if it comes to pass. However we will press on with a positive disposition.\n",
      "Recent increases in the overall deficit were necessitated by volatile and uncertain international and regional conditions. This along with the increase in the Government's debt ceiling is geared toward stimulating economic activity and expanding the infrastructure necessary for growth. Government's macroeconomic policies will remain focused on maintaining a manageable debt burden while ensuring that any further deficit increases contribute to productivity gains and growth through sustainable strategies that use the knowledge of our people as the main input.\n",
      "With a low debt service ratio and high levels of official reserves, the fiscal position remains strong, allowing for increased deficit financing to be directed to strategic investments aimed at building sustainable productive capacity. This notwithstanding, in this period of fiscal con- straint, the Government must act prudently, investing in strategies that offer a solid return. Accordingly, the policy shifts being introduced give priority to initiatives that promote knowl- edge-intensive, innovation-driven growth that creates higher income jobs. Monetary policy will continue to contribute to macroeconomic stability by stimulating growth and signalling to private sector financial institutions the need to increase lending for investment and growth.\n",

This policy will be developed by the Ministry of Planning and the Economy (MPE) with the support the Economic Development Board (EDB) and will result in the establishment of an Innovation System that comprises the supporting mechanisms for financing, intellectual property protection and linkages between research and development and commercialisation.\n",
      "The NIP will place increased focus on small and micro entrepreneurial activity, which has the potential to contribute significantly to job creation, economic growth and social development. Government will move to re-align the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Sector (MSE) with the aim of expanding the country's entrepreneurial capability. Expansion of the Sector is part of an overall Competitive Business Sector Strategy.\n",
      "The National Business Incubation Policy and the National Integrated Business Incubator System will provide a comprehensive nurturing environment that utilises best practice to support the development of new entrepreneurs and innovative MSEs. This Policy will enhance the link between entrepreneurship and MSE development, supporting and encouraging the entrepreneur to transform ideas into high-value products and services. The Fair Share Programme provides an opportunity for MSE growth as it allows for 10 per cent of Government contracts to be awarded to qualified MSEs and encourages large private contractors to sub-contract to MSEs.\n",
      "Creativity in larger, export oriented business leading to innovation will be encouraged and supported.

      "In respect of manufacturing, Government will stimulate the sector as an area of economic diversification as it directly and indirectly creates employment. Currently, employment within the sector averages approximately seven (7) per cent of the total employed population.\n",
      "Emphasis will be placed on specialised skills training and development to encourage competitiveness and sustainability within the Sector. The development and adoption of green manufacturing practices will give local manufacturing firms a competitive edge given the emphasis on creating a green economy.\n",
      "Cluster development aids the progress of the Sector. The Tamana Intech Park and the Cove Business Park will provide high-value manufacturers with a competitive advantage in high- quality infrastructure and business to business opportunities.\n",
      "The following areas have been identified for diversification within the sector: biotechnology, information technology, high-tech manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food production and agro- processing and ship building, repair and servicing. In addition to these areas, significant work has already taken place in the area of Printing and Packaging. A proposal for the establishment of a printing and packaging Institute has been completed. Work will continue on a development programme for the Food and Beverage Industry which aims to increase innovation and commercialisation.\n",
      "In addition, the following measures will be instituted:\n",
      "· A programme of incentives to support sustained export expansion\n",
      "69\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "· An Innovation Financing Facility (IFF), aimed at small businesses and individuals. The IFF will provide individuals with pioneering business ideas with the means to access financing to build and commercialise their concepts. The Council for Competitiveness and Innovation (CCI) and Caribbean Industrial Research Institute (CARIRI) will play important roles in this regard.\n",
      "· The Research and Development Facility at the Business Development Company (BDC) Limited will be expanded to encourage more firms to engage in Research and Development (R&D).

This notwithstanding, Government recognises that there is tremendous potential for growth within the Sector by shifting from the reliance on mostly upstream and midstream activities to more productive and efficient downstream activities. It also involves penetrating new markets regionally and internationally.\n",
      "Efforts to increase our proven energy reserves through the opening up of more blocks for bidding has led to the award of contracts to firms engaging in both onshore and offshore operations. Increasing our downstream products and markets will continue to enhance our value-added capacity. Government is also exploring ways to diversify within the sector with a specific focus on expanding the energy services component and exploring alternative energy sources. Some of the specific initiatives to support diversification of this sector include:\n",

      "Developing alternative energy sources will benefit the economy through achieving greater diversification and stability and will also ensure energy security for the country in the long term as oil and gas resources are depleted. Energy services employ a large percentage of the Sector's workforce.\n",
      "With over 100 years accumulated experience and expertise in the sector, there is tremendous scope for nationals to fill the international skills gap that currently exists in other established and newly emerging energy producing countries.\n",
      "As the world seeks to find alternative energy sources that are less detrimental to the environment, investment in the renewable energy market has been identified as an option for lucrative exploration. The development of a Renewable Energy Policy will expand the country's energy mix into alternative energy sources such as solar, biomass and wind energy and encourage investment and partnership opportunities with companies that engage in or use renewable energy alternatives.\n",
      "A Carbon Reduction Strategy Task Force has been established and mandated with the responsibility to develop a National Carbon Reduction Strategy and a regulatory and policy environment and to recommend suitable projects and incentives to attract investment. Promoting energy efficiency in both the public and private sectors through energy audits will increase our environmental responsibility.\n",
      "Critical to the success of this sub-sector is the creation of a supporting environment that features a strong legislative framework, investment incentives for both producers and consumers and a skilled workforce.

The Investment Policy 2011-2015 will prescribe the legislative changes necessary to improve the institutional and regulatory framework for investment. These changes will inform the drafting of a new piece of legislation - an Investment Promotion Act, will be geared towards facilitating the growth and expansion of foreign as well as, domestic investment in Trinidad and Tobago. The policy will identify challenges to investment promotion and recommend strategies to target investors. With the expected improvement in the availability of data, the Investment Policy will track the performance of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows; the growth of domestic investment; identify the factors that make this environment more favourable to potential and existing investors as well as introduce new policy approaches and strategies identified to facilitate investment. Initiatives such as the Government Hotel Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Programme will be geared towards attracting investment flows into the tourism sector.\n",
      "Government will also restructure the Trinidad and Tobago International Financial Centre Management Company Limited (TTIFCMCL) as part of an improved institutional structure designed to create a new thrust in investment facilitation. The Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Council for Competiveness and Innovation (CCI) will also collaborate to improve global competitiveness and to support an investment strategy for diversification. The role of eTeck in this configuration will also be taken into account.

      "Government is also committed to the strengthening of the legislative framework for the ICT sector, with a view towards ensuring regulatory oversight of competition issues. The Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT) will continue to review and revise the regulatory framework to facilitate the stimulation of investment opportunities in the sector, particularly infrastructure development.\n",
      "The National Information and Communication Technology Company Limited (iGovTT), is the central ICT agency of the Government and will continue with the implementation of the National ICT Strategy. There are several enterprise solutions under the Government Backbone Communications Network, (GovNeTT) and the Government Electronic Portal, (ttconnect) that are geared towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Government's service delivery. These will be rationalised, integrated, connected and made functional.\n",
      "In terms of integrating internet-enabled education throughout the school system, one of the initial steps taken to achieve this objective is the roll out of the eCAL project. Other initiatives to be undertaken include expansion of secondary schools' connectivity, teacher training and infusion of ICT into curriculum delivery.\n",

The first phase of the SEW, dubbed TTBizlink, was launched in February 2011. Three (3) business services are being offered via TTBizlink - application for import duty concessions, fiscal incentives and work permits.\n",

      "Improvements to the legislative framework to facilitate the use of the ICT infrastructure for business have been essentially advanced with the approval by Parliament of the Electronic Transactions Act and the Data Protection Act. Within the government sector, implementation of the Public Sector Reform Computerisation Programme, geared towards the development and modernisation of ICT in the public sector will also continue. In addition, the operations of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) will be improved through the use of electronic means of collecting and disseminating information. Within the Police Service, a Digital Security Agency will be established, with the capability to detect, combat and protect against cybercrime in both the private and public sectors. In addition, the establishment of the Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network (CKLN) will create opportunities both in the knowledge and business sectors once the production capability to access the world is developed.\n",

      "Modern and efficient physical infrastructure (water, electricity, roads and bridges and drainage) provides the platform for achieving growth and competitiveness. Government's policy is to ensure that the quality, reliability and maintenance of existing infrastructure is of the highest standard, while adopting transparent and fair procurement practices. In this effort, having a high local value-added is deemed a necessity for job creation, generating economic activity, building local capacity and using foreign exchange inputs efficiently.\n",

      "In terms of transport, a National Transportation Study will guide the development of an efficient, diverse transportation system so as to ensure the movement of people and goods within, and between Trinidad and Tobago. High on the Government's agenda for medium- term is the construction of the $7.2 billion highway from San Fernando to Point Fortin. The first phase of the Project is expected to create 10,000 jobs. Government has required that a minimum of 40 per cent of all labour (both skilled and unskilled labour) and at least 40 per cent of the materials, equipment and supplies used for the Project must be sourced from the local economy.\n",
      "Resources have also been mobilised for the restructuring of the layout of the Scarborough Terminal Building and reconstruction of the ferry service cargo jetty at the Port of Port of Spain. Additionally, the Licensing Authority will be transformed into a Motor Vehicle Authority\n",

      "which will use as its foundation, Canadian best practices. This construction of 10 licensing sub-offices is also planned which will improve significantly service delivery to the population. The management of roads and bridges will be strengthened with the establishment of a Roads and Bridges Authority which will have responsibility for determining the appropriate network of roads, highways, underpasses and the new bridges to be constructed. The operations of the Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) will be significantly improved with the acquisition of 100 new buses and the building of a strong in-house maintenance capacity.\n",
      "Government remains committed to improving the poor road infrastructure in many parts of the country. These planned projects/programmes will increase the number of jobs available in the local construction sector while improving the road network to allow for expansion of commercial businesses throughout the country, notably within the five (5) targeted growth poles. Priority attention is also being given to drainage infrastructure. A Drainage Action Plan which includes a set of measures to be undertaken to, among other things, clear drains and major water courses will be complemented by a Nationwide Preventative Drainage Maintenance Programme targeting main, secondary and tertiary drains. A Drainage and Irrigation Authority will also be established.\n",

      "· Usage of alternative energy\n",
      "· Maximisation of revenue generation\n",
      "With regard to telecommunications, actions to be taken include connection of customers to a fibre network; expansion of telecommunication-driven security services to consumers, general upgrade of the IT Infrastructure (Servers, Switches) necessary to provide services over the Fibre Network; upgrade of the Mobile Network to 3rd/4th generation system and upgrade of the broadband wireless (WiFi/WiMax) to facilitate higher download speeds. All of these initiatives will create the infrastructure and platform for ICT industry expansion and proliferation.\n",
      "Strategy: Significantly Improve the Business Environment\n",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's business environment has not kept pace with international business developments. The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index indicates that out of 183 economies surveyed, Trinidad and Tobago's ranking has decreased from 95 recorded in 2010 to 97 in 2011.\n",
      "The Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Council for Competitiveness and Innova- tion (CCI) have been charged with the responsibility for addressing the constraints that now exist.\n",
      "Government will also develop an Industrial Policy linked to innovation that will give credence and strengthen the viability of existing manufacturing firms according them selective and targeted incentives to increase productivity and export-led growth. The Policy will also highlight new areas in which the economy can diversify and most important, provide the framework of laws necessary for all businesses to successfully participate in markets. Similarly, the Services Industry Strategy will also identify and support viable services capable of penetrating foreign markets.\n",
      "The development of an integrated National Export Strategy will provide suppport for improved performance of those products and services with a high export potential. Improving export performance will not only focus on negotiating increased access for exportable products to priority markets but also include steps to improve our country's competitive advantage and\n",

      "increase national competitiveness. Therefore, in essence, an integrated national export strategy is a critical initiative in the thrust to diversify the economy. Complementing this strategy will be a Trade Policy with the primary purpose to delineate a clear path for Trinidad and Tobago's engagement in trade issues at the local, regional, hemispheric and multilateral levels. The Policy will also offer recommendations on how local businesses can grow non-energy exports and widen the export mix. These initiatives are crucial in moving the diversification thrust forward.\n",
      "Improving the country's competitiveness will also be given a boost by finalising the Investment Policy which will prescribe the legislative changes necessary to improve the institutional and regulatory framework for investment. The Foreign Investment Act of 1990 will be repealed. This Act though amended was written during an era of relative protectionism and addresses issues of land acquisition by foreign investors and regulates the number of shares foreign investors can acquire in private and public companies. The current policy will inform the drafting of a new Investment Act which will take into consideration Trinidad and Tobago's commitments under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, and under the many bilateral investment treaties signed with foreign countries.\n",

      "Re-orientation of Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs\n",
      "Government is giving priority to the development of a more focused and coordinated approach to the management of international economic relations through, inter alia, the establishment of new institutional arrangements for better execution of the country's Foreign Policy. The initiatives over the medium-term will be guided by the phrase 'Small Country Big Impact' which underscores the intention to advance the ideals of the country regardless of the constraints associated with small size.\n",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Policy accordingly focuses on developing/enhancing relations with strategic countries at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels and active participation in the multilateral arena. The new thrust in foreign policy will focus on strengthening capacity to ensure that the pursuit of foreign relations redound to the benefit of the country and citizens and allow for improved responsiveness to international developments.\n",

      "Under the new foreign policy agenda, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Communications, the strategies to be employed will include:\n",
      "· Enhancing market intelligence to identify new opportunities for economic diversification and new markets\n",
      "· Expanding the export base of key sectors\n",
      "· Working with the business community to prepare more businesses and first time exporters to successfully engage in international trade\n",

The Trade Policy 2011-2015 will focus on facilitating private sector trade expansion in high value goods and services that capitalise on local expertise and knowledge. There are a number of areas in which the Government will act to improve the policy environment, institutions and linkages. Increasing the level and application of technology in the trade sector will also facilitate growth and diversification of private sector trade activities.\n",
      "Our position regarding exports, industrial operations, and most importantly the services industry must be clearly articulated to ensure integrated sustainable growth in these areas. The development and implementation of a National Export Strategy, an Industrial Policy and a National Service Industries Strategy will ensure that the path forward is clear and well integrated. The process of pursuing international trade arrangements will include the business sector and other stakeholders to ensure that trade and economic partnership agreements yield maximum benefits for market expansion and penetration.\n",
      "As part of the strategy of becoming globally competitive, steps will be taken to establish a commercial, economic and political presence in emerging markets. To this end a more aggressive trade policy will be pursued with Central America, South America and Asia. This\n",

      "All of our citizens have the right to and de- serve a decent standard of living that con- forms to the tenets of a just, humane and ci- vilised society. Consequently, the existence of poverty in our society deprives citizens of the right to live with dignity, free from want. Furthermore, economic and material depri- vation often has the additional negative ef- fort of wounding the human spirit.\n",

      "· Reduce Poverty (Target: 2% per year to 2015)\n",
      "· Reduce the Poverty Gap (Target: 4.6% to 3.5% by 2015)\n",
      "· Reduce the Gini coefficient (Target: 0.39 to 0.21 by 2015)\n",

      "Living in poverty is a debilitating experi- ence. Housing, health and education are usually minimal, as inadequate financial re-\n",
      "sources and limited options mean that families are persistently unable to fully participate in meaningful social and economic activities. In addition, poverty creates a sense of hopelessness as well as socio-economic disparities that foster dependence, a shirking of responsibility and a stifling of thought and actions that are crucial to ambition and the legitimate expression of one's self in productive activities. At the extreme, it heightens social tensions and threatens social stability. Moreover, the phenomena of child poverty, which can lead to the abuse of chil- dren and the involvement of youth in criminal activity, robs us of critical human capital and this cannot be allowed to continue.\n",
      "Admittedly, while there are those who are truly in need of assistance and deserving of Govern- ment and private support, our strategy must be to ensure that this support ultimately allows citizens to be legitimately empowered and transition successfully out of poverty. In the context of Government's vision that 'we shall prosper together' the continued existence of poverty is not acceptable. Steps will be taken to reduce and eventually eradicate this.\n",
      "Based on the 2005 Survey of Living Conditions (SLC), 1.2 per cent (approximatley 15,600 persons) of Trinidad and Tobago's population was indigent, earning TT$3,060 or less per annum. Approximately 15.5 per cent (approximately 201,500 persons) of the population was\n",

      "81\n",
      "deemed poor, earning TT$7,980 or less per annum, therefore cumulatively, 16.7 per cent (approximately 217,100 persons) of the population could be classified as poor and fell below the poverty line. A further nine (9) per cent (approximately 117,000 persons) of the population was considered vulnerable.14\n",
      "The level of inequality as measured by the Gini-Coeficient has remained relatively unchanged over the last decade. The 2005 Survey of Living Conditions indicated that the Gini-coefficient was 0.39 and that the poverty gap was 4.6 per cent. Based on the 2008/2009 Household Budgetary Survey, indications are that the level of poverty has in fact increased by approximately two (2) per cent between 2005 and 2009. What this means is that the most recent energy boom did nothing to reduce poverty and that the financial/economic crisis of 2008-2009 exacerbated the situation. This Government makes a commitment that the level of poverty in this country will be reduced.\n",
      "In Trinidad and Tobago, the groups identified as most vulnerable to poverty are:\n",
      "· Persons with low levels of education\n",
      "· The unemployed, underemployed, unskilled and semiskilled workers\n",
      "· Single parent households\n",
      "· Female headed households\n",
      "· The elderly\n",
      "· The differently-abled\n",
      "There is also an observed intergenerational transfer of poverty. Poverty is directly related to unemployment as individuals as well as households require income to sustain an adequate standard of living. Investment, business creation and growth of the economy are, therefore, absolutely essential so that jobs and income can be generated and strategies need to be developed to encourage investment and entrepreneurial initiatives in poverty stricken areas.\n",
      "The provision of housing is critical to achieving the broader objective of poverty reduction. The housing problem in Trinidad and Tobago is two-fold. Firstly, there is an insufficient supply of adequate and suitable housing to meet current and future needs. Secondly, there is an issue of affordability, which is intrinsically linked to a supply-demand imbalance and which continues to be of great concern. According to the Trinidad and Tobago Housing Development\n",

      "Corporation (HDC), there are approximately 130,000 applicants for housing. Over 50 per cent of these applicants fall below the minimum TT$4,000 monthly income ceiling for accessing housing. The housing plight is further expressed in what seems to be a growing epidemic of squatting.\n",
      "The Land Settlement Agency has estimated that towards the end of 2010, there were 300 known squatter settlements across both islands comprising approximately 300,000 squatters, constituting approximately 24 per cent of the population.\n",
      "An enduring solution to the problems in the housing sector and its impact on poverty can only be found through implementation of an integrated and holistic housing policy that incorporates concepts such as community creation, innovation and sustainability. It is with this in mind that the goal of the housing policy is to create a housing system that provides access to decent and affordable housing for all and communities which are socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.\n",

      "STRATEGIC APPROACH\n",
      "A major effort will be mounted by Government to reduce the level of poverty, with the intention of eradicating this phenomenon in the long-term. The strategy is to break the cycle of poverty, enable self sufficiency and create opportunities for wealth generation. Government will, therefore, take the necessary actions to:\n",

      "The restructuring of the economy is geared towards the creation of opportunities for sustainable employment and wealth generation. Specific actions to be taken include:\n",
      "· Implement initiatives to stimulate the construction sector and create high value production systems in the agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, craft, fashion and ICT sectors as well as in new strategic areas\n",
      "· Streamline skills-training to match the needs of expanding sectors, ensuring a greater production and absorption of skilled workers into the labour force\n",
      "· Continuous review of the minimum wage through a functional Minimum Wage Board, taking into account proxies that reflect economic performance and cost of living\n",
      "· Enhance sustainable livelihood strategies of both rural and urban households such as encouraging self-help initiatives to mitigate poverty\n",
      "· Create industries that will allow women to work at home with flexible hours but meeting targets and objectives within a specified timeframe supported by training and development\n",
      "· Train people participating in make-work programmes to facilitate their stepping up from poverty into economic and financial self sustainability.\n",
      "Strategy: Increase Access to Adequate and Affordable Housing\n",
      "Apart from fulfilling man's basic need for shelter, owning a home empowers the poor through the acquisition of an asset and also facilitates socio-economic participation. Appropriate housing solutions will be provided through collaboration and joint venture arrangements with small, medium and large contractors, focusing primarily on poor and low and middle income households. In addition, Government will:\n",
      "· Review existing financial arrangements such as the provision of grants, subsidies and mortgages in order to further alleviate the issues of affordability and accessibility, par- ticularly among poor and low income households\n",
      "· Transform squatter settlements through upgrade and regularisation, into more planned, sustainable communities to reduce the plight of squatters in accordance with the Squat- ter Regularisation Act No. 25 of 1998\n",
      "· Review existing legislation and adopt public awareness initiatives in order to contain further squatting\n",

      "· Use skills assessment centres as a basis for retooling, reskilling and upgrading the skills of unskilled workers\n",
      "These strategies will be implemented alongside other broad measures to ensure that housing provision is sustainable, contributes to successful development of communities and incorporates the innovation thrust of Government's overall policy. The first of these measures will be to encourage innovation in building design, construction and finance of HDC homes. Sustainability and sustainable living will be incorporated by ensuring that housing and community designs utilise the natural environment and use energy efficiently; and that there is a focus on best practices in green and environmentally-friendly buildings through recycling and conservation methods. Government will move to endorse as a benchmark for green building a Green Building Index to be enforced through the implementation of a Code for Construction Quality Acceptance for energy efficient building projects.\n",
      "Secondly, the existing housing stock will be retrofitted to ensure energy efficiency and environmental compliance. An Urban Regeneration and Renewal Programme will encourage all income groups to inhabit Port of Spain through the provision of a wide range of housing types and the improvement of the existing housing areas. To promote building of new communities that are integrated and sustainable, a key feature of new HDC developments will be communities that are equipped with community centres, homework centres and play parks. Housing solutions will aim to maximise the use of the existing building stock by utilising vacant properties wherever possible. The Land Distribution Policy will be revisited as a viable option to satisfying the demand for accommodation.\n",

The focus will be on the prevention of poverty by targeting the most vulnerable through early intervention to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Measures to be taken include:\n",
      "· Restructure social safety net programmes to improve targeting and delivery and avoid duplication\n",
      "· Place emphasis on the development of healthy functional families, with the provision of food support, counselling, skills training and other financial initiatives, offering much needed social support to improve the quality of life of society's most vulnerable\n",

It is an integral component of the formula for growth and development because it endows citizens with the ability to create and generate knowledge and transform this knowledge into high value-added products and services that can create market niches and better paying jobs. The rate and extent to which new technologies are utilised to enhance competitiveness within our economy also depends on the level of development of our human capital to absorb and deploy them.\n",

However, a critical reorientation of our education system must be effected in order to foster the development of global citizens who can interact and compete on the world stage.

Priority attention is being given to the development of new, modern subject areas and methods of learning as well as new teaching methodologies that are technology focused - to which today's youth can relate and adapt easily. In addition, the reform efforts will focus on strengthening teacher training and succession planning as well as effectively addressing the administrative bottlenecks within the education system in order to facilitate better management of schools. A very significant component of the reform effort is the integration of ICT throughout the school system. Government has already initiated the process through the e CAL Project. These reforms will impact upon the quality of education delivery and the school environment. The receptivity of students towards learning as well as the inculcation of values and attitudes such as lifelong learning and productivity will build human capital and create citizens who will make a positive contribution to society.\n",
      "The drop-out rate at secondary schools must also be addressed. This rate stood at two (2) per cent or approximately 2,000 students for the 2008/2009 academic year. This number has significant implications for developing our human capital since these dropouts if not aided, may fall into poverty or begin a life of crime. This highlights the importance of promoting values such as lifelong learning and productivity at the primary school level.\n",
      "In relation to tertiary level education, one of the main issues is the relevance of this system to existing industry and economic needs. Statistics show that close to 40 per cent of University of the West Indies (UWI) graduates are either unemployed or underemployed with the unemployment rate of UWI graduates after one year being about 18 per cent. Due to the absence of a Labour Market Information System (LMIS), the mismatch between the current demand and supply of skills in the economy persists. This lack of absorptive capacity of the economy contributes to the outward migration of trained graduates to the developed countries to take advantage of more lucrative job opportunities, while severe shortages of those much needed skills exist in several critical areas in the domestic economy, including the Health Sector. There is also need to identify areas for investment which will in turn provide the direction for the\n",
      "89\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "types and levels of skills needed in the future. In this way, our human capital will be better aligned to our development needs. There is a dire need to rationalise the existing tertiary sector, transform curriculum, align institutions to clearly defined outcomes linked to the market and economic diversification strategies. This will be done and the Government Assistance for Tuition Expenses (GATE) Programme will be realigned to play a more strategic role than the mere expansion of the participatory rate. The tertiary sector also needs to create entrepreneurs and innovators that are respected and who can be wealth and job creators in the economy.\n",
      "To achieve greater synergies between the education and training systems and the labour market, in order to better realise and utilise our human capital potential, a more coordinated, structured and focused approach towards building human capital development is needed. The development of a Human Capital Development Committee comprising key stakeholders such as the Labour Movement, the Ministry of Planning and the Economy, the Ministry of Labour, Small and Micro Enterprise Development, the Economic Development Board, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Tertiary Education, the Ministry of Trade and Industry as well as employers; and employers' institutions and business organizations will aid in this regard. A Human Capital Policy will also lend support to the needed structured approach.\n",
      "Our training system possesses strong quality standards and awarding institutions. Industry spe- cific training in key sectors also exist as well as affordable educational opportunities facilitated by Government support. However, as is the case with tertiary education, greater alignment with the needs of the economy has to be achieved. Mechanisms must also be put in place to provide opportunities for the professional development of educators, trainers and teachers.15 Additionally, there exists a small pool of experienced and certified instructors available nation- ally, which must be increased as continued skills shortages negatively impacts the develop- ment of our human capital.\n",
      "To address the skills shortages, while simultaneously building our human capital through skills and knowledge transfer in needed areas, the forging of new partnerships and renewal of existing global partnerships will be pursued. This will be done through worker exchanges and internships as well as through the provision of incentives to attract experts and skilled workers to Trinidad and Tobago.\n",

      "The existing pool of skilled nationals who have migrated must also be utilised to further address skills shortages and build our human capital. Incentives to motivate these citizens to return (temporarily or permanently) to share their knowledge and expertise in building our country, must be developed. The first step in this process is to develop a skills base of these nationals. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Communications will play a key role towards developing an action plan for implementing these measures. The graduating pool of approximately 5,000 students per year from the tertiary sector including returning national scholars (approximately 200 plus per year) will be treated as a key resource to attract knowledge investments.\n",
      "The desire by citizens for lifelong learning must also be supported by employers, if our human capital is to be further built. Incentives to employers will be provided so that they will be encouraged to upgrade the skills of their employees in key development areas.\n",
      "STRATEGIC APPROACH\n",
      "Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to building human capital. The first aspect entails ensuring that the basic needs of citizens are met.

Students must be confident in themselves, be self motivated, enterprising and able to work independently as well as with others. In addition, students must be able to lead, be responsive to the challenges of new roles and manage conflict.

      "THE ROLE OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND NEW INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\n",
      "The economic and social transformation being pursued requires bold steps by, and close collaboration among, key actors in the economy and the society. Furthermore, the imperatives of building an innovation-driven economy requires that all key stakeholders and institutions including public sector organisations, operate as high performance, professional entities, that demonstrate the requisite levels of effectiveness and efficiency in their service delivery.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR\n",
      "The Public Service of Trinidad and Tobago must position itself, through partnerships with key stakeholders, as a key facilitator for achieving an innovation-driven economy that is based on greater inclusiveness and equity. It must strike the right balance between social imperatives and economic objectives; it must meet rising public expectations by delivering faster results and must provide officers with modern tools and policies that improve service delivery as well as create public value. Moreover, it must recognise and reward creative ideas and practices, while adhering to the principles of merit, competency, flexibility and fairness as it employs innovative ways of meeting the diverse needs of stakeholders.\n",
      "In order to position Trinidad and Tobago as a global leader in the 21st Century, priority will be given to:\n",
      "· developing the capacity of managers to manage effectively and achieve excellence\n",
      "· attracting, nurturing and retainng the best possible talent\n",
      "· transforming the traditional hierarchial directive management system into a values- driven and knowledge-based management model\n",
      "To serve our citizens in the 21st Century, the Public Service must build effective collaborations across different functions, units, Ministries and Agencies as well as with business and civil society. Such collaboration, is vital to overcoming regulartory weaknesses, market failures and resource constraints that undermine efforts to successfully expand economic opportunity and support an economy that is driven by investments, productivity growth, competitiveness and inovation.\n",
      "99\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "The drive for the renewal and modernisation of the Public Service is ongoing to ensure that it becomes a responsive organisation and one with a clear focus on service delivery for the purpose of ensuring that Government's performance achieves optimal levels of excellence. In understanding citizens' expectations and increasing customer satisfaction, a citizen-centred approach will continue to be utilised for the delivery of high-quality public goods and services. The Renewal and Modernization Programme for the Public Service is aimed at strengthening people and service capability and improving key structures and systems by focusing on the following six (6) areas:\n",
      "1. Operationalise the governance framework of the public service;\n",
      "2. Redesign and build the Human Resource Management (HRM) architecture for a 21st Century public service;\n",
      "3. Develop and implement the service delivery policy framework and architecture;\n",
      "4. Build the human resource capability and capacity for national development;\n",
      "5. Build business continuity management capacity; and\n",
      "6. Guide the strategic direction and policy formulation of the telecommunications sector.\n",
      "By focusing on and improving these six (6) areas, Government will be able to strengthen the Public Service to achieve greater levels of efficiency and productivity. It follows that in the face of global change, uncertainty and complexity, the Public Service of Trinidad and Tobago needs to adopt a bold and innovative approach to be successful. There is the need to develop our own capabilities, recognise and seize opportunities in order to earn a competitive advantage. By reforming the Public Sector, we hope to improve the Ease of Doing Business Index and create the conditions that are conducive to higher productivity, the generation of greater confidence, and an increase in both local and foreign investment.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n",
      "Over the medium-term, it is expected that the private sector will play a greater role than in the past in the area of investment in support of economic transformation. Government is of the view that an annual investment level of approximately $20 billion (US$ 3 billion) by the private sector both local and foreign should complement the annual $7-8 billion in public sector investment spending to be undertaken by Government during the same period. In addition, publicly owned institutions also invest heavily in infrastructure development and there are going to be opportunities for divestment of some State-owned enterprises over the next three (3) years. Investment from the private sector is needed to improve productivity and\n",
      "100\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "competitiveness, to expand exports, to begin to expand beyond the CARICOM market and to diversify its investment portfolio in alignment with new markets.\n",
      "The domestic private sector must strive to double exports in the non-energy sector over the next three (3) years as Trinidad and Tobago has signed and will continue to pursue new trade and investment agreements with countries in Latin America. The manufacturing sector currently utilises under 70 per cent of its productive capacity and the services sector has real prospects for export growth especially in information, knowledge and creative services. The doubling of exports and operating at near full capacity in manufacturing and expanding the services sector would mean an increase in jobs, national income, growth and of course profits. The focus for existing private sector firms must be on market penetration and expansion given that market access has been achieved through investments to improve competitive capacity and innovative approaches to business growth.\n",
      "There is the need for existing companies and new entrepreneurs to undertake investments in some of the existing and emerging sectors which have the capacity for cluster formation and value chain upgrading. Examples include: culture, tourism and food and beverage. The domestic private sector is capable of capitalising on wider regional markets, notably Central America as the stepping stone towards conquering global market opportunities. As for the larger companies inclusive of the conglomerates, there must be investment in R&D as well as restructuring and re-engineering for growth rather than just performance. A focus on performance will improve margins but it will not achieve growth. Achieving a greater share of international markets, acquisitions or joint ventures and cross border clusters, are the areas in which the local private sector should focus its attention and energies.\n",
      "Government is committed to creating and providing the environment for the private sector to excel and will, therefore, work with the businesses to achieve investment targets, improve the business climate as well as enhance competitive, technological and innovation capacity. For its part, Government will improve the policy and regulatory environment for business expansion. In addition, public sector investment spending also has the benefit of increasing growth in the private sector primarily through the execution of infrastructure-type projects.\n",
      "Collaboration between the Government and the private sector in the provision of key services will be advanced through the use of the PPPP model for delivery of suitable infrastructure projects. The objective is to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks in Trinidad and Tobago and expand access to effective and efficient infrastructure and infrastructure-related services\n",
      "101\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "through the application of PPP models. Government, through the Ministry of Finance will identify two (2) or three (3) relevant pilot PPP projects. It is expected that in developing and implementing these pilot PPPs, the technical, managerial and institutional capacity to design and manage PPPs will be developed and embedded within key Government Ministries and Agencies. The PPP Project is supported with a Grant from the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).\n",
      "ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY\n",
      "A key comparative advantage of Civil Society (CS) is its ability to respond to the different circumstance and needs of the forgotten and disadvantaged. CS serves as a much needed interface between the public and private sectors and persons and communities at the grassroots level.16 Their position at the frontline of community activities allows them to formalise the input of citizens and develop more targeted and effective interventions to local problems, some of which are internationally created.\n",
      "Strong and strategic partnerships with civil society groups are key to the successful planning and implementation of the agenda for social and economic transformation, especially in the context of globalisation which can widen inequities and place more persons on the margins, leaving society more polarised than ever in terms of wealth and possessions.\n",
      "The agenda for transformation requires that our CS acquire new skills and competencies in developing new communication methods, as well as stronger networks and more effective methods of cooperation, which could lead to new technical and funding opportunities from private and international sources. It also requires new systems in terms of public access to information, the mutual sharing of competencies in technical and administrative areas and the development of codes of conduct for organisations and their interaction with others.\n",
      "The goal is to reduce uncoordinated and isolated interventions that are planned and implemented without the knowledge and involvement of key actors and to increase the relevance and legitimacy of CS.\n",
      "Government's model of regional development, which is based primarily on community involvement and participation, relies heavily on social partners including Civil Society. Given the ability of civil society groups to network, share information, access services and\n",
      "16 Civil Society (CS) consists of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Community-Based Organisa- tions (CBOs) and Faith-Based Organisations (FBOs).\n",
      "102\n",
      "INNOVATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK 2011 - 2014\n",
      "opportunities for educational advancement, they offer invaluable input towards community development. Together, they also form a network representing the voice of the people on issues affecting communities. CS will therefore be expected to a play greater role in the establishment of Regional Development Plans as well as in developing the five (5) growth poles communities identified by Government. In addition, through the Economic Development Board, and through the establishment of the Civil Society Board (CSB), CS will be able to contribute to and influence, economic policy and socio-economic decision making.\n",
      "ROLE OF THE LABOUR UNIONS\n",
      "Economic growth and development cannot be realised unless the workers who are engaged in the production of goods and services assist in determining how goals and strategies are to be pursued. In this context, the labour movement is recognised as a positive force for economic development and trade unions are considered central to the maintenance of an effective industrial relations environment that balances the need for private enterprise to become and remain competitive with the aspirations of workers for higher wages and better working conditions.\n",
      "Government sees the role of trade unions as more than just collective bargaining. Firms are the ones that are engaged in competition and as representatives of the workers, trade unions are vital stakeholders in the process of planning and decision-making for the conceptualisation and implementation of programmes and projects to achieve business growth, improved levels of productivity wherever workers are located and sustainable development for our country.\n",
      "Trade unions have contributed to social and economic transformation by providing stability in the country, ensuring that the rights of workers are maintained. It is essential that the labour movement play their rightful role in helping to define and in supporting an enlightened socio- economic transformation agenda, through an effective multipartite engagement that allows all parties to have a meaningful and responsible role in the process. Workers must not be alienated from the development process and to ensure inclusion, workers must participate.\n",
      "The unions have an important role to play in raising productivity in the workplace by dialoguing with management in search of innovative ways for the enterprise to become globally competitive. We view the labour movement as partners in development and part of the solution to the creation and development of a highly skilled, better paid workforce and an innovation- driven economy. Innovation derives from human capacity and the human imagination and we\n",

The role of the EDB is to reshape our strategies for economic development by facilitating diversification and achieving a diversified economy within the framework of sustainable development. The EDB and the CCI will work together and support the Ministerial Council, chaired by the Honourable Prime Minister and execute actions as required to achieve competitiveness and diversification with high value-added investments. The Ministerial Committee on Energy will focus on issues related to the petroleum economy.
